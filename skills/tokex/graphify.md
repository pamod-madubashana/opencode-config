# /graphify

Turn any folder of files into a navigable knowledge graph with community detection, an honest audit trail, and three outputs: interactive HTML, GraphRAG-ready JSON, and a plain-language GRAPH_REPORT.md.

## Usage

```
/graphify                                             # full pipeline on current directory
/graphify <path>                                      # full pipeline on specific path
/graphify <path> --mode deep                          # thorough extraction
/graphify <path> --update                             # incremental re-extraction
```
